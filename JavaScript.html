                Like the FileIO activity, my group split this activity into parts. Each of us were in charge of a certain unit conversion. Leo and I made the HTML and CSS template for the pages while the rest of the group was finalizing a style tile. We made this template to make sure that our pages stayed uniform, other than the JavaScript unit conversations. With this activity, we faced two main problems: error checking and time constraints. We wanted our conversions to be as efficient as possible and did not want the user to input anything other than numerals into the input boxes. We also faced an issue in which we got a NaN error whenever we deleted input in one of the boxes. We were able to find a way that solved both of these problems: if (isNaN(this.input)). If this decision structure was true, we made both the strings empty. Another major issue we faced was time constraints. We had spent too much time on the HTML and CSS template, rather than implement the JavaScript into each page. Therefore, when Mr. O told us that we had to be done in twenty minutes, my group went into a frenzy. We started rushing to make our pages and started to take shortcuts in our source control, such as skipping pull requests. This led to many issues and merge conflicts and ended up taking more time than if we did not take the shortcuts as we had to fix these errors.
