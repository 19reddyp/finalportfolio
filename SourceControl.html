                My group approached the FileIO activity by splitting it into parts. We laid out our tasks on the whiteboard and made sure that everybody knew what their job was. We also knew that in order for our separate programs to work together, we had to make sure that certain things, like the type of parameter passed, stayed consistent throughout all of our code. There were three main difficulties I faced: the enigma of file input/output, my unfamiliarity with C#, and my different operating system. Since I have not taken Data Structures yet, I had very minimal exposure to FileIO when starting this activity. Therefore, I did not really know how to tackle the problems and spent a lot of time on Stack Overflow familiarizing myself with the syntax. This introduced me to some new syntax, such as Streamreader(). Although C# is very similar to Java, there were a few differences that were troublesome. First, I learned that I should not use arraylists but rather should use a generic list. Next, I learned that unlike Java, C# does not have a .get() method. Therefore, I had to look for a similar method in the C# reference. Other small variances, such as system.out.println() being Console.WriteLine(), were also discovered, but for the most part C# resembled Java. Another challenge that I faced was that I was the only person in my group with a Macbook. This was especially difficult due to the differing file systems which also meant different file directory structures. This meant that the code and input for finding a file was different on my computer than on my teammates’ computers. This made testing my code and its compatibility with the other code very difficult. Overall, I learned lots about working in a team, how FileIO functions, and some basic syntax in C#.
