                The MVC activity was an extension of the JavaScript activity. The activity consisted of taking the client-side unit conversion page and converting it to a server-side application. Therefore, much of the CSS and basic HTML was already completed. As a group, we decided to split the activity up by conversion and set some conditions on our code. We wanted our output to display in the opposite input box and wanted to clear the opposite input box if one of the boxes is edited. We wanted the server-side version of our website to mimic our client-side version. The only difference between the two would be that the server-side website would require a submit button. The problem that we had the most trouble with was clearing the opposite input box if the output in either box was edited. We wanted to do this because running our convert function with input in both boxes would cause an error as it would convert the units back and forth. In order to accomplish this task, Leo and I worked on implementing JavaScript into our views. We searched W3schools for a while and finally found an event that worked with the rest of our code: onkeyup(). A minor issue we ran into was using the layout styling file to give a uniform style to every page. Our styling was showing up differently on each computer. We were able to find some small differences in our codes that fixed our styling.
