                The Full Stack Summer Camp experience introduced me to various new programming languages, databases, project management/source control, and further developed my communication skills and experience with full stack development. Before attending this camp, I had very little experience with coding. My only computers class I had taken in high school was AP Computer Science A which focused on the language Java. During the camp, I learned that Java was a fairly useless programming language in comparison to its hard-coded counterpart C#. The camp introduced me to the syntax and function of many diverse programming languages, such as C#, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Using these languages, we developed multiple projects while learning and implementing good source control and project management habits. These projects were very helpful in my understanding of the languages as they each focused on one specific aspect/language and isolated it to make sure that it is learned. The camp also showed me what a career in software development would look like. We were placed in random Scrum groups in the beginning of the camp as in a real job, we would not be able to choose our coworkers and would have to still communicate and do our jobs. In the beginning of the camp, our scrummates did not know each other very well. However, by the end of the camp, we knew each other very well and were aware of our strengths and weaknesses. Knowing each scrummate’s strengths and weaknesses allowed us to efficiently seek help when needed. Also, while working in the groups, we learned the importance of planning our code before we wrote it. We needed to set conditions on our code so that each of our parts would work together and ensure proper project management. Using the knowledge I gained during the camp, I can now work on both the front and back end of web applications. Even if I do not go into the computer science field, my experience with working in a team and planning will be very useful. Overall, the Full Stack Summer Camp was an invaluable experience.
